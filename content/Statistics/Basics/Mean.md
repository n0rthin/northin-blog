Mean value of set of numbers is sum these numbers devided by amount.

### Usage
Imagine you have 5 customers. Each paid you different amount of money:
$\$1200, \$1100, \$1150, \$900, \$1500$.

You can get insight on how much money you make on average from each customer by calculating mean value:
$(\$1200 + \$1100 + \$1150 + \$900 + \$1500) / 5  = \$1170$

*But some customers bring more money and some less?*
Yes, but they'll balance each out. Some customers will pay you more then $1170 and some less. 

$\$1200 + \$1100 + \$1150 + \$900 + \$1500 = 5 * \$1170 = \$5850$

The calculating mean value is basically answering the question: I made $5850 last month, If each customer would have paid the same amount of money what this amount should be to sum up to $5850.

Mean value allows you to ignore *variance* in your data and treat values as equal.
But this can lead to problems in situations when variance cannot. In such situations it might be better to use [[Median]]
