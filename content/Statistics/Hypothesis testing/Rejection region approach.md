We need to chose a value which is probability of rejecting H0 hypothesis if it's true.
Usually a=0.05 
If test is two-tailed:
Split a evenly between two tails
Regions above/b
Critical value separates distribution into rejection region and the region where we don't reject H0. 
If z-score falls into one of the rejection regions we reject H0

Downside:
If critical value is 1.645 then we would reject Z=1.646 and not reject Z=1.644. These two values have almost the same evidence for H0, but completely different conclusions
To solve this [[p-value]] should be used

For normal distribution
1. Choose a value
2. Get critical value from the table
3. Calculate Z
4. Check if Z higher/lower then critical value
