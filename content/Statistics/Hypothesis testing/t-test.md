t-test is used when population true standard deviation is not known
Instead sample deviation is used. But in this case test statistic distribution won't be [[normal distrubution]] but [[t-distrubution]] wih n-1 degrees of freedom (where n is sample size). The more degrees of freedom t-distrubution has the more it closer to normal distrubution.

There are **three main types of t-test:**

-   An [Independent Samples t-test](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/t-distribution/independent-samples-t-test/) compares the [means](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/statistics-definitions/mean-median-mode/#mean) for two groups.
-   A [Paired sample t-test](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/t-test/#PairedTTest) compares means from the same group at different times (say, one year apart).
-   A [One sample t-test](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/hypothesis-testing/one-sample-t-test/) tests the mean of a single group against a known mean.

1. Choose [[confidence level]]
2. Obtain sample mean of control group
3. Obtain sample mean for experiment group
4. Obtain sample deviation experiment group
