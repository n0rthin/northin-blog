p-value is a measure of the strength of the evidence against the H0
Definition:
p-value is the **probability** of getting the observed value of the test statistic, or a value with even greater evidence against H0, if the H0 is true
the smaller the p-value the greater evidence against H0



For normal distribution
1. Choose a [[significance level]]
2. Calculate Z
3. Get p-value for Z (from table)
4. Check if Z higher/lower then significance level
