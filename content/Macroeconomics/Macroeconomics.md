Macroeconomics is a study of how governments manage economy. Macroeconomics looks at economy as a whole

Macroeconomics is divided into six major theories (studies):
1. [[Level of economic activity]]
2. [[Aggregate demand and aggregate supply]]
3. [[Low unemployment]]
4. [[Low and stable inflation rate]]
5. [[Economic growth]]
6. [[Equity in distribution of income]]

There are three players in macroeconomy:
1. Producers of goods - companies, manufacturers, private contractors, etc.
2. Consumers of goods
3. Government - tries to manage economy so that needs of producers and consumers are met by achieving certain goals.

There are four goals that government has with respect to economy:
1. Economic growth (healthy rate is 2%)
2. Low unemployment rate (healthy rate is 5%)
3. Low and stable inflation rate (healthy rate is 2%)
4. Equitable distribution of income (taxes, everyone should have equal opportunity)

Two tools to manage economy that they can use to achieve goals:
1. [[Fiscal policy]] - controlled by government
2. [[Monetary policy]] - controlled by [[Central bank]]

Macroeconomics assumes that government officials are elected democratically (through voting mechanisms).
