In the same way as [[Fiscal policy]], monetary policy can be either expansionary or contractionary:
- expansionary monetary policy has a goal to increase economic policy
- contractionary monetary policy has a goal to decrease economic policy

Monetary policy is controlled by [[Central bank]], not by government.

Central bank has to options for monetary policy:
1. [[Interest rates]] - higher rates lead to decreased economic activity and vice-versa
2. Money supply
