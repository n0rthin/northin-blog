Inflation is persistent increase of average price in economy - everything gets more expensive

Inflation should be stable and predictable

The goal is to have 2% inflation. If economy grow then wages will grow with it. The healthy [[economic growth]] is 2%, so the goal is to keep inflation at the same rate as economic growth.
(why can't we make wages grow faster then inflation?)
