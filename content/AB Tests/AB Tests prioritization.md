Golden rule: 
Pick low-hanging fruits first

Three principles for prioritization:
- Business priority
- Estimated commercial benefit
- Ease of implementation

Things to consider when assigning priority:
1. Ease of implementation
2. Potential business benefit
3. Which part of the funnel the experiment is focusing on. Later stages of funnel usually easier to optimize
4. The scale of the changes. Avoid [meek tweaking](https://conversion-rate-experts.com/method-marketing/). Bigger change -> potentially higher affect on the metric -> easier to detect change in the test
5. Consider weather the experiment supports a business objective
6. Calculate what increase in CVR (or other metric) would do to revenue. If the test would detect [[Minimal Effect of Interest (MEI)|MEI]] how the revenue will change?
