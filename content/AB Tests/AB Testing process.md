Will offering product bundles increase revenue per customer?
Average grand total of order with 1 print product: €39
Average grand total of order with 2 print products: €45
(45 - 39) / 45 = 0.13
Offering a product bundles that save over 13% for a user will likely increase revenue per user.
If we offer users a product bundle that saves over 13% for them
Then revenue per user will increase
Because having an option to buy more products and pay less will incentivise users to make more purchases
